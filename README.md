# Hospital Navigator

## Overview

The **Hospital Navigator** is a web-based application designed to provide facility mapping in hospitals, enabling the public to easily track and access healthcare services. This tool helps patients, visitors, and staff navigate through complex hospital layouts, ensuring efficient movement and enhanced safety within healthcare environments.

## Problem Statement

Hospital environments cater to diverse populations with varying needs. Proper facility mapping is crucial to ensure that all individuals can find their way efficiently within a hospital. The application addresses the need for better navigation and tracking within hospital premises, contributing to improved patient care and operational efficiency.

## Aim

To develop a user-friendly facility mapping application that enables the public to effectively track and utilize hospital resources.

## Abstract

Given the intricate design of hospital spaces and the unique needs of various users, this project utilizes engineering and computational models to create an intuitive mapping system. The tool enables users to identify key locations, navigate through buildings, and understand facility layouts in both emergency and non-emergency scenarios.

## Features

- **Indoor Navigation**: Provides turn-by-turn directions through hospital buildings, accommodating various user needs.
- **Resource Management**: Enhances operational efficiency by tracking the availability and movement of essential medical equipment.
- **Building Maintenance Management**: Facilitates proactive maintenance to reduce costs and improve safety.
- **Live Asset Tracking**: Helps locate critical equipment, minimizing loss and enhancing patient care.
- **Safety and Security**: Integrates real-time information for improved incident response and enhanced safety measures.

## Methodology

The development of the Hospital Navigator involves several key steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering accurate information about hospital layouts and resources.
2. **GIS Mapping**: Using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to create interactive maps.
3. **User Interaction**: Implementing widgets for users to select starting points and destinations, updating maps dynamically.
4. **Testing and Optimization**: Continuous testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of navigation paths.
